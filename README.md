# Workdone

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Workdone is a to-do-list, habit tracker game that helps getting work done. You can use Workdone by your favourite
browser, Chrome app or Android app. 

Workdone primarily uses Firebase as its backend solution. As frontend framework we use Vue.js with all it's flavour including [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader), [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) and [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex). We also use Materialize, material design CSS bundle and Packery, the grid item solution.

## How to start?

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
**All contributions are welcome**

Workdone in the past had its own backend which you can find here: [/workdone-backend](https://github.com/PoprostuRonin/workdone-backend)
